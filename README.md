# 🎓 School & 🎬 Cinema Database with Excel

This project demonstrates the structure of a SQL database using Excel sheets for a School and Cinema database. 📊

## 🗂️ Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to better understand SQL database concepts by organizing data in Excel spreadsheets. The columns and structure resemble typical SQL tables, helping visualize how data is stored and related.

- **School Database**: Contains columns like `Student ID`, `Name`, `Class`, `Grade`, etc.
- **Cinema Database**: Includes columns like `Movie ID`, `Title`, `Genre`, `Showtime`, etc.

## 🌱 Learning Purpose

This project is intended for educational purposes, allowing me to explore and practice the fundamentals of database design and structure without needing a full SQL setup.

## 📂 Files

- `School_Database.xlsx` - Excel file with the school-related data structure.
- `Cinema_Database.xlsx` - Excel file with the cinema-related data structure.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Download the Excel files from the repository and explore the structure. Compare it with SQL database designs to see how similar concepts apply.
